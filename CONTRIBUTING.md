# Contributing to PICO-8 Game

This document provides guidelines for developers who want to work on this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) (licensed version recommended, but education edition also works)
- Git for version control
- Visual Studio Code for advanced code editing and version control

### Setup

## Development Guidelines

### PICO-8 Specific Guidelines

#### File Organization
- Keep main game logic in `src/main.p8`
- Split large features into separate `.p8` files
- Use meaningful file names that describe their purpose
- Maximum one game concept per file when possible

#### Code Style
- Use **snake_case** for variables and functions: `player_speed`, `update_enemies()`
- Use **UPPER_CASE** for constants: `MAX_HEALTH`, `SCREEN_WIDTH`
- Keep functions small and focused (remember the token limit!)
- Add comments for complex logic or algorithms

#### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: `player_x`, `enemy_count`, `is_jumping`
- **Functions**: `init_game()`, `update_player()`, `draw_ui()`
- **Sprites**: Use descriptive names in sprite editor
- **Maps**: `level_1`, `menu_bg`, `tileset_main`
- **Sound Effects**: `sfx_jump`, `sfx_coin`, `sfx_enemy_hit`
- **Music**: `mus_title`, `mus_level`, `mus_gameover`

#### Performance Guidelines
- Be mindful of the 8192 token limit
- Optimize sprite usage (128 sprites max)
- Use efficient algorithms for collision detection
- Minimize unnecessary calculations in `_update()` and `_draw()`
- Use `_update60()` only when necessary

### Version Control

#### Commit Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense: "Add player movement", "Fix collision bug"
- Keep commits focused on single changes
- Reference issues when applicable: "Fix #123: Player falls through platforms"
- Atomic commits

## Documentation

- Update documentation when adding new features
- Keep the README.md current with setup instructions
- Add code comments for complex algorithms
- Document any external dependencies or tools

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Help newcomers learn PICO-8 development
- Share knowledge and best practices
- Follow the project's code of conduct
- Give credit where credit is due
