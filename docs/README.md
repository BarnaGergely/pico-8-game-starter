This directory is intended for project documentation and guides.

Documentation is essential for maintaining and sharing your PICO-8 game project.
This folder should contain files that explain your game's design, mechanics,
development notes, and any other relevant information for developers and players.

Recommended documentation to include:

- Game design document (gameplay mechanics, story, art style)
- Development notes and progress logs
- Code architecture and structure explanations
- Asset creation guidelines and specifications
- Installation and setup instructions
- Contributing guidelines for collaborators
- Changelog and version history

For PICO-8 specific documentation, consider including:

- Sprite and map usage documentation
- Music and sound effect notes
- Performance optimization notes
- Token count management strategies
- Custom function libraries documentation

Keep your documentation up to date as your game evolves. Well-documented
projects are easier to maintain, debug, and expand upon.
